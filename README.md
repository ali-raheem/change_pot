# Change Pot

Data on the change in my change pot. I add coins randomly to this pot and rarely remove them although I have a collection of unique design coins which do not go into the pot which likely biases the data.

| Coin | Count | Value  |
|------|-------|--------|
|   1p | 37    | £0.37  |
|   2p | 47    | £0.94  |
|   5p | 75    | £3.75  |
|  10p | 24    | £2.40  |
|  20p | 63    | £12.60 |
|  50p | 15    | £7.50  |
|   £1 | 38    | £38.00 |
|   £2 | 6     | £12.00 |
|      | 305   | £77.56 |
